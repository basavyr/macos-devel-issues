# Resources for macOS 11 BigSur

The newest macOS November 2002 update introduces a new version - BigSur, which is a new major release of macOS.

These are some useful packages for usage after a clean install of the OS.

## Python - virtual environments & separate package management

macOS BigSur still comes with the system installed Py2 and Py3 version of Python. However, these should be never used by user within development projects. The system-based python packages are just for app compatibility.

Solution for using Python for science/development projects is provided in several useful guides. It is essential to use `pyenv` and a python package manager, like `poetry` and `pipenv`. Below there are some useful guides for configuring your macOS with a proper python environment suitable for development/science.

[Installing Python packages in 2019: pyenv and pipenv
](https://gioele.io/pyenv-pipenv) - *The objective of this small guide is to describe how pyenv, pipenv and various other tools work together to install and manage Python packages. This guide is aimed at those who would like to have a look behind the scenes to understand how modern Python packaging tools work together.*


In this current build of macOS (referring to the local machine on which development takes place), `pyenv` and `pipenv` are configured so that oen can set different python versions for each project. Installing packages (e.g. `scipy`, `numpy`) is taken care of by `pipenv`. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **BigSur** issue: The latest macOS version has compatibility issues with the latest version of `numpy` and latest version of Python (that is 3.9).

‚ÑπÔ∏è As a result, the current system uses Python `3.8.6 ` and `numpy-1.18`

## Pipenv issues
___

### Numpy

Issues with the process of installing (which was also mentioned above) was solved by installing an older version, together with an older version of python itself.

It is considered that latest version of Python (that is `3.9`) it is having compatibility issues with BigSur. As a result, this might cause numpy package to fail when trying to run python scripts with the package imported.

### Matplotlib

When using `pipenv` to install the `matplotlib` package (which is used for plotting data and creating complex graphs), the installation process fails. Even when attempting to install different versions of matplotlib, the installation process would still not finish successfully. 
**Potential reason**: the pipenv package manager (that takes advantage of virtual environments within the python paradigm) was installed **via Homebrew**. Many threads on github indicate that the package for macOS managed by Homebrew is deflective with improper support.

üåü Solution: use `pipenv` by installing it with `pip`. Since the virtual environment was already set up to work with `py-3.8.6`, the pip (that is pip3 actually) replaced the Homebrew version of pipenv. [This issue](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues/1169) discusses about other similar situations where Homebrew version of `pipenv` fails to work properly when installing packages.

Furthermore, the installation process still failed, but the error message indicate the fact that a `jpeg` library was missing. Using [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64884415/cant-install-matplotlib-on-macos-big-sur), the solution is to install the `libjpeg` service via Homebrew.

*TL;DR:*

* ‚úÖ use `pipenv` installed via `pip`, and not via Homebrew.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è make sure the `libjpeg` service is available on the machine (it can be installed via Homebrew).

It is worth mentioning that these solutions were only tested on macOS BigSur.
