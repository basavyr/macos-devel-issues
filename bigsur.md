## Python - virtual environments & separate package management

macOS BigSur still comes with the system installed Py2 and Py3 version of Python. However, these should be never used by user within development projects. The system-based python packages are just for app compatibility.

Solution for using Python for science/development projects is provided in several useful guides. It is essential to use `pyenv` and a python package manager, like `poetry` and `pipenv`. Below there are some useful guides for configuring your macOS with a proper python environment suitable for development/science.

[Installing Python packages in 2019: pyenv and pipenv
](https://gioele.io/pyenv-pipenv) - *The objective of this small guide is to describe how pyenv, pipenv and various other tools work together to install and manage Python packages. This guide is aimed at those who would like to have a look behind the scenes to understand how modern Python packaging tools work together.*


In this current build of macOS (referring to the local machine on which development takes place), `pyenv` and `pipenv` are configured so that oen can set different python versions for each project. Installing packages (e.g. `scipy`, `numpy`) is taken care of by `pipenv`. 

‚ö†Ô∏è **BigSur** issue: The latest macOS version has compatibility issues with the latest version of `numpy` and latest version of Python (that is 3.9).

‚ÑπÔ∏è As a result, the current system uses Python `3.8.6 ` and `numpy-1.18`
