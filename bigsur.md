## Python - virtual environments & separate package management

macOS BigSur still comes with the system installed Py2 and Py3 version of Python. However, these should be never used by user within development projects. The system-based python packages are just for app compatibility.

Solution for using Python for science/development projects is provided in several useful guides. It is essential to use `pyenv` and a python package manager, like `poetry` and `pipenv`. Below there are some useful guides for configuring your macOS with a proper python environment suitable for development/science.
